        <p>Welcome to 100xdevs.</p>
        <p>
          This is an initiative by
          <strong> Harkirat Singh </strong>
          to personally mentor folks in the field of Programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Harkirat strongly feels that today you are either a 1x engineer or a
          100x engineer and nothing in the middle, and his hope is to take
          everyone in this community to be a <strong> 100x Engineer.</strong>

          focus on Open source projects to learn programming practically.
